												<div class="mid" id="HiddenDiv" style="display: none;"><font align="right"></p>Effective recommendation systems improve customers' experience and lead to loyalty. We are studying various approaches for designing recommendation systems using neural networks. We focus on exploiting temporal, spatial (user network) and hierarchical structure in the data using node and edge embeddings, graph convolutional networks, recurrent architectures, and variants. We systematically investigate how each of these innovations contributes to the overall performance of recommendations using data from large recommendation engines.

												<div class="mid" id="HiddenDiv1" style="display: none;"><font align="right"></p>We consider the design of promotional pricing strategies to stimulate the adoption of a new product whose consumption features network effects. A key aspect we model is the public uncertainty in the perceived utility of the product across the market and hence the anticipated adoption level. We focus on strategies that naturally arise from two informational considerations: either the firm fully alleviates the perceptional uncertainty so that consumers make informed buying decisions, or induces the consumers to make their adoption decisions blindly, i.e., based only on the prior public belief. For an uninformed firm, this public signaling of information is orchestrated by: a) providing a vanishingly small discount for early adoption in the case where it is beneficial to have the customers make informed purchase decisions, and b) providing a steep discount for early adoption in the case where it is beneficial to have the customers make their purchase decisions blindly. In the first case, most of the adoption takes place in the later informed period, while in the latter, all adoption takes place in the early blind period. We show that in the system limit where the products become more niche, i.e., the variance of the perception of the product across the target population is small, then inducing informed adoption results in a higher profit than blind adoption. On the other hand, if this variance is high, which is the case for products with a mass appeal, then inducing blind adoption results in a higher profit than informed adoption. Numerical analysis suggests that restricting to these two intuitive strategies incurs negligible loss relative to the optimal promotional pricing strategy. </p>

														<div class="mid" id="HiddenDiv2" style="display: none;"><font align="right"></p>Although  the  computational  and  statistical  trade-off  for  modeling  single  graphs,for instance, using block models is relatively well understood, extending such resultsto  sequences  of  graphs  has  proven  to  be  difficult.   In  this  work,  we  take  a  step  inthis  direction  by  proposing  two  models  for  graph  sequences  that  capture:   (a)  linkpersistence between nodes across time,  and (b) community persistence of each nodeacross time.  In the first model, we assume that the latent community of each node doesnot change over time, and in the second model we relax this assumption suitably.  Forboth of these proposed models, we provide statistically and computationally efficientinference algorithms, whose unique feature is that they leverage community detectionmethods that work on single graphs.  We also provide experimental results validatingthe suitability of our models and methods on synthetic and real instances.</p>

											<div class="mid" id="HiddenDiv3" style="display: none;"><font align="right"></p>Store flyers are a key component in the promotional portfolio used by the retail industry. While the extant literature has studied the impact of flyer design on consumer behavior, research on methodology to facilitate flyer design is lacking. The goal of this study is the design of a retail store flyer, which first requires to determine an assortment of products to promote, second price and promotion type, and lastly layout and position. We focused on the following: First, further exploring the data set to identify interactions between categories and product characteristic and using this information to modify the demand model and simplify the optimization; Second, designing an approach to make column generation feasible for flyer design; and lastly, performing a numerical study that integrates the demand model and solution approach.</p>
